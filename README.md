# TCP_IP-Strain-Telemetry-Data
This repository allows wireless data sending of strain measurements from the IBSEN I-MON 256 USD to a PC running MATLAB. The server program is coded in LabView as add-ons of the original interrogator's software while the client program is coded in MATLAB to receive and storage the stain data.
